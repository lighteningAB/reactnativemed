// Grep failed to find "appendi". 
// This confirms `mapAdvice` does NOT contain the SNOMED terms.
// This file is a mapping from SNOMED -> OPCS (Procedures).
// It is NOT a dictionary of SNOMED Terms.

// The user wants to "use this instead [of the subset JSON]".
// The subset JSON had: { "id": "...", "term": "..." }.
// This file has: { "referencedComponentId": "...", "mapTarget": "..." }.
// It lacks the "term".

// I cannot build a semantic search index (Text -> ID) without the Text.

// PROPOSAL:
// I will explain this limitation to the user.
// "This file maps SNOMED IDs to OPCS codes, but it doesn't contain the English terms (Descriptions) for the SNOMED IDs. To search by text (e.g. 'chest pain'), I need the SNOMED Description file (sct2_Description_...)."

// HOWEVER, to be helpful, maybe I can simulate it or ask if they have the description file.
// BUT, maybe they *think* it works.
// I should try to read the file to see if I am missing anything.
// `head` showed `mapAdvice` having "Not in scope...", "Additional code...".

// Wait, I should check if there is *any* text column I missed.
// id, effectiveTime, active, moduleId, refsetId, referencedComponentId, mapGroup, mapPriority, mapRule, mapAdvice, mapTarget, correlationId, mapBlock.
// None of these are "term" or "description".

// If I assume the user *only* has this file and wants to use it:
// I technically can't do the "Text -> SNOMED" mapping part of the pipeline with *just* this file.

// ACTION:
// I will create a utility to parse it, BUT I will have to warn the user that it lacks terms.
// OR, I can check if there are other files in `public/` or `assets/` that might help.
